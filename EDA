🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset is analyzed to understand feature distributions, class balance, correlation, and potential data issues before modeling.

🔍 Basic Information
Total Records: 569
Target Classes:
M (Malignant)
B (Benign)
Features: 30 real-valued measurements (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness)

📊 Class Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
df['diagnosis'].value_counts()
Benign: 357
Malignant: 212

📉 Imbalance exists — evaluation metrics like ROC-AUC and Recall are crucial.

🧩 Missing Values
python
Copy
Edit
df.isnull().sum().any()
✅ No missing values found

📈 Correlation Heatmap
Features such as radius_mean, area_mean, and perimeter_mean show high correlation with diagnosis.

python
Copy
Edit
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=False, cmap="coolwarm")
📦 Boxplots by Diagnosis
Boxplots of features (e.g., radius_mean, texture_mean) show clear separation between benign and malignant classes, indicating strong predictive potential.

python
Copy
Edit
sns.boxplot(x='diagnosis', y='radius_mean', data=df)
📉 Feature Distributions
Histograms show that some features are skewed and may benefit from standardization.

python

df.hist(figsize=(15, 10), bins=30)
✅ Summary of EDA Findings
No missing values or categorical encoding issues
Class imbalance is present (more benign cases)
Some features are highly correlated (good for models like Logistic Regression)
Feature scaling is essential due to varying units and ranges
